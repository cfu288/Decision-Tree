NOTE: These numbers are the ones I got from running the program on my local machine. 
For some reason running this code on the LDAP machines resulted in slightly higher 
values than the ones I got here.

I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have 
I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism 
or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this 
form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will 
receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will 
receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.

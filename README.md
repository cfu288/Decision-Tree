I have done this assignment completely on my own. I have not copied it, nor have 
I given my solution to anyone else. I understand that if I am involved in plagiarism 
or cheating I will have to sign an official form that I have cheated and that this 
form will be stored in my official university record. I also understand that I will 
receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment for my first offense and that I will 
receive a grade of “F” for the course for any additional offense.
